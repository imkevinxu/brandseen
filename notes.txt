Hey I've done similar games! check http://color.method.ac. You need to convert hex to CIELab, and then apply a color difference formula http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference
Don't let the complex versions put you down, the simplest formula is good enough, just Math.sqrt( Math.pow(L1-L2, 2) + Math.pow(a1-a2, 2) + Math.pow(b1-b2, 2) ).

FOUNDATION
----------
- change "if settings.DEBUG:" in urls.py
- add 404/500
